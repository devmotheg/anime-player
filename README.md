# Anime Player

Challenge from Tenzin's list of projects (⌐■_■)

One of my best projects so far because, one... I like anime, and two... it taught me A LOT about APIs and modules.

## Features

- After playing an opening you can change the current time of the opening by clicking on the track-bar.
- You can change the volume of the current song by dragging the volume range on the left-hand side.
- If a song finished the next one automatically plays (if it's the last one the first one will play next).
- Accessibility navigation can be done by pressing the "Tab" and the "p"/"P" keys.
